<!-- The position property in CSS tells about the method of positioning for an element or an HTML 
entity and the positioning of an element can be done using the top, right, bottom, and left 
properties. There are five different types of position property available in CSS:

1.Static: The default value. Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the page.
2.Relative: Elements are positioned relative to their normal position.
3.Absolute: The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor
                instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed.
4.Fixed: The element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the 
                same place even if the page is scrolled.
5.Sticky: The element is positioned based on the userâ€™s scroll position. -->
