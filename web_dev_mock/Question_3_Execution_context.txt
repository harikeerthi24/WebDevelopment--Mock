Execution context:

-->Execution context in JavaScript refers to the environment in which the code is executed.
-->It consists of the variable environment, lexical environment, and the value of 'this'. 
-->The execution context determines the scope, accessibility, and lifetime of variables and functions during the execution of the code.
To understand execution context, let's break it down into two main types:

1. Global Execution Context:
            The global execution context is the default context when JavaScript code is first run. 
            It includes the global object (window object in browsers) and the 'this' value refers to the global object. 
            The global execution context sets up the global scope and makes variables and functions available throughout the code.

2. Function Execution Context:
            When a function is called, a new function execution context is created. 
            Each function call has its own execution context, which includes its own variable environment and lexical environment. 
            The 'this' value within the function execution context depends on how the function is called.

diagram illustrating the relationship between global execution context and function execution contexts:

```
-------------------------------------------
|             Global Execution Context     |
|-----------------------------------------|
|     Variable Environment (Global Scope) |
|           Lexical Environment            |
|              this (global object)        |
-------------------------------------------
            ^
            |
            | Function Call
            |
-------------------------------------------
|          Function Execution Context      |
|-----------------------------------------|
|       Variable Environment (Local Scope) |
|           Lexical Environment            |
|                this (function object)    |
-------------------------------------------
```

In the diagram,
-->The global execution context is at the top, representing the initial state when the code starts executing. 
The function execution context is created when a function is called, forming a stack of execution contexts. 
Each function execution context has its own variable environment and lexical environment, which handle variable declarations and function definitions within the function's scope.

-->The function execution context is popped off the stack when the function finishes executing, 
    returning control to the previous execution context.

Overall, the execution context provides the necessary environment for the code to run, 
manages scope and variable accessibility, and determines the value of 'this' within the code execution.
